# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my **Data Science Projects** repository!  
This repository showcases a collection of projects highlighting my skills in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **data visualization**.  

Each project is designed to solve real-world problems and demonstrates the complete data science workflow:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, trends, and key insights.
- **Model Development**: Applying statistical methods and machine learning models.
- **Visualization & Insights**: Creating intuitive and actionable visualizations.
